# Data Structures

## Linked-lists
- data structure that represents a linear sequence of verticies(nodes), has a head, tail, length
- value, next, previous
- There are:
  - singly linked lists
  - doubly linked
  - multiply linked
  - circularly linked
  
### Time and space complexity 
- Data Structure Operation	Time Complexity (Avg)	Time Complexity (Worst)	Space Complexity (Worst)
Access	Θ(n)	O(n)	O(n)
Search	Θ(n)	O(n)	O(n)
Insertion	Θ(1)	O(1)	O(n)
Deletion	Θ(1)	O(1)	O(n)
