## Test and Test Driven Development(TDD)

- TDD(Test driven development): strategy to develop a program where the requirements are turned into tests and developed until all test cases are passed.
- common TDD workflow for a method
  1. write a new test
  2. run all tests and check for fail
		- if a test passes without anything being written, should be rewritten/evaluated
	3. make changes to the method to satisfy the tests
	4. run all tests and check for pass
  	- go back to step 3 if any tests fail
   	- if all tests pass, but more coverage/edge cases are needed, go back to step 1
- once all 4 steps are complete, 1 iteration of TDD is complete
