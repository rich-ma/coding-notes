## Bubble Sort
- algorithm: sequence of actions to take, usually to solve some problem.
- bubble sort is an aglorithm that 'bubbles' the highest value to the top
  
- Let's see one pass of bubble sort on the array [2, 8, 5, 2, 6]. On each step, the elements currently being scanned are in bold.

- 2, 8, 5, 2, 6 - ordered, so leave them alone
- 2, 8, 5, 2, 6 - not ordered, so swap
- 2, 5, 8, 2, 6 - not ordered, so swap
- 2, 5, 2, 8, 6 - not ordered, so swap
- 2, 5, 2, 6, 8 - our first pass is complete

- in the above example, the 8 is bubbled up to the end of the array, as well as several of the other larger values in the array
