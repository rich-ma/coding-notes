# distributed systems and architectures

1. How do you deploy applications to cloud?
2. be reliable to world
3. How do we serve tons and tons of simultaneous users?

Heroku has its own computer that is running your system for you.
Heroku uses AWS EC2, elastic cloud computer, to run its servers.

to replace heroku
---
- rent computer from amazon
- has public dns address
- ssh to log into some computer somewhere else
- 

using different name than amazon name
- told amazon to give a static IP address, that you can rename, elastic-id
- Can also 

**IP address vs DNS**
- when a computer wants to contact another computer, it needs Internet Protocol address(IP)
- not enough to know name, need to know address as well.
- if I wanted to find address before, would use a phone book
- Domain is yourname, IP address is your physical address.

- first step is finding IP address using DNS with your domain name.
- second step is to connect.

Once you have a static (elastic) ID, can create a custom domain name.

C-Name is an alias?
A-Name goes directly to an IP?

## Replace Heroku (cont)
- create DNS, need to get into server, and run it
- need to 


## Web Apps and DB performance
- Two problems
  - as more users want to talk to machine, it won't have enough CPU power to respond to all requests.
  - Can be worse if requests have more DB work.
  - if templates are complicated, could slow things down.
  - will hit a limit based on CPU.
  - 

- Can horizontally scale, just add more machines.

# Scaling up
- can vertically scale, try to make our own code faster, improve the computer or code.
- can fix bad code
- can keep simple code and upgrade hardware instead.
- make code more optimized and pay engineers, or buy better hardware and let engineers work on other products.

## slow
- hitting db is slow, writing data, reading data.
- all data lives in either RAM or hard disks.
- RAM, allows you to store and access data, much faster
  - RAM is an electrical circuit that you can send signals to to remember info, can store and access data.
  - responds to signals very fast, faster than physical moving components.
  - because ram is eletrical, if you lose electricity, will lose everything stored there, vs a physical store.
- RAM is non-persistant data, must be saved in disk.
- big trade-off in persistance and fast access/writing.(ram vs hd)
-
