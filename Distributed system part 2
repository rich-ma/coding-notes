# distributed systems lesson 2

how to distribute work of database?
- want to scale out DB, first need to attack the reads to db.
reads vs updates
- easier to handle reads than to handle updates
- most apps read heavy, few updates.
- if we have a solution that handles lots of reads, but doesn't improve writes, could still be ok.
