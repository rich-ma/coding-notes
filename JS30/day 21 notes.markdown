- can also get heading, velocity, along with the actual geolocation
- in chrome, can fake locaiton, but not heading or speed, can use ios simulator.

- need to download xcode to simulate a phone, that way we can get heading, velocity
  - need to access geolocation, need to use secure location, https, etc.
