# day 5
- using flex: 1, will tell the children to evenly distribute space to each other
  - can also calc using vw(viewer width)
  - otherwise they will only take up as much space as they need, depending on the text within.
  - justifying content will not work as this does not change the inner width, 

- can give flex: with a larger number and it will be that scal larger than evenly distributed. 3 will be 3 times kater than evenly split ones.
