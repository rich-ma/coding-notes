# html canvas
- dont draw on canvas, but on the context.
- can set the canvas width/height to window.innerWidth, and innerHeight, respectively
- start drawing with context.beginPath(), end it with context.stroke()
- can add other things like strokeStyle, need to tell it what to draw, rect, line, etc.
