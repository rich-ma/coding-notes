# Continuous Integration
The practice of continuous merge/integration of code into the main code repository backed by builds and test cases.

new practice to merge more often, instead of having a bad experience

## Staging branch

Using a staging branch that mirrors the master where you can test all your code.


# Circle CI(continuous integration)
- big plus for resume
- if building and testing work, circleci will deploy automatically as well.
- utilizes docker and images to setup the enviornment for our tests, can setup postgreSQL, or ruby with specific versions for the testing environment.
- saves cached gemfiles and will check them to see if you need to 'bundle install' again or not.
