Why learn DevOps?
The process of code development/deployment
What is DevOps?

Traditional

PM -> Engineers -> QA -> release -> Operations

Specs, development,

- Specs are what PM want in the code
- Development is the development process of creating the code
- QA test code, Quality Assurance, Quality Engineering
- Write integration and e2e tests, but not always
- Lots of manual testing, 

Release

- Maintain a release queue, 
- Responsible for reals cycles and rolling back features of it breaks

Operations

- Making sure code runs smoothly, 
- Manage infrastructure, scalaingto match traffic, demand
- Monitor services and application health to ensure no bugs in prod
- Responsible for infrastructure and production bugs.

Disadvantages

- slow time to production
- Lack of collaboration
- Too many operators, not enough developers.

Solution
- QA, Release, Operations can be automated.
- Merge them all into DevOps(engineers, QA, release, operations)
- ```DevOps is a way to deliver software with shared pain and responsibility```
