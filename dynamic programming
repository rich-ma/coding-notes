# Dynamic programming
Top-Down
- can calculate values as we go down the stack, storing it in the call itself, or in a local variable somewhere else.
- saving work to previous sub problems as you go.

bottom-up
- using a cache that builds up as we go
- subsequent answer is stored as you move up fib.
- **essentially, but is dynamic, saving work to previous sub problems as you go to avoid doing extra work.**

longest increasing subsequence
[1,5,2,6,10,4,20] => [1,2,6,10,20]

by knowing best one that ends in each index, we will know the best solution.  

Doing a perm in linear time is a good reason to use dynamic programming
- keep track of sub solutions
- each decision relies on relationship with subselections.

keeping track of highest possible as we move forward, looking back two away.
input:[1,5,16,20,3,7,10,5,10,25,17] = 62
maxes:[1,5,17,25,25(25 > 17+3),32, 35(25 + 10), 37, 45, 62, 62] both are highest
- as you move along, you take the record from the one that you chose.
 
 usually keep track of a cache of solutions to smaller subproblems

 We can:
 1. keep globally scoped variable
 2. pass a pointer to the cache from call to call, **passing by reference**
  - in javascript all non primitive types are passed by reference, so we could pass a hash or array
  - in ruby, everything is passed by value, meaning that when something is passed into the function, the function makes a copy of the paramenter then refers to and mutates the copy. 

  we can use a class in ruby to create instance variables that we can use as a cache, one for each dynamic programming problem.
  - will only use this method for top-down implementations
  - for bottom-up implementations, a helper function will build out and return the cache so we dont have to worry about updating it while doing the recursive calls.
    - wont want to really do this in a real life situation because you will most likely be working with classes, functional scope, or other context that allow you to create and maintain and cache in a reasonable way.

    - for whiteboarding, just create a global variable that you can refer to, but tell the interviewer about what you're doing, assuming the cache is globally scoped, and explain how you would implement it.

## Blair numbers
- b1 is 1
- b2 is 2
-kth blair number is the sum of prev 2 blair numbers plus the (k-1)th odd number

## Knapsack

- know this before going to any onsite
- 0 or 1 knapsack problem
- each item has weight and value, either will include item, or won't
- create a table to represent our data
- going to only consider one item at a time, figure out by looking at increasing window of cacpcity, what is max value that we can acheive with only items in our window so far.
- at cap 0, max val is 0.
- come up with logical way to figure out given cases, inductive step.
- 


```ruby
  def knapsack(weights, values, capacity)
    return 0 if capacity.zero? || weight.length.zero?
    solution_table = knapsack_table(weights, values, capacity)
    solution_table[capacity][-1]
   
  end

  # Helper method for bottom-up implementation
  def knapsack_table(weights, values, capacity)
    solution_table = []
    0.upto(capacity) do |i|
      solution_table[i] = []
      0.upto(weight.length - 1) do |j|
        if i == 0
          solution_table[i][j] = 0
        elsif j == 0
          solution_table[i][j] = i < weights[0] ? 0 : values[0]
        else
          option1 = solution[i][j-1]
          option2 = i < weights[j] ? 0 : (solution[i-weights[j]][j - 1] + values[j])
          solution_table[i][j] = [option1, option2].max
        end
      end
    end
    solution_table

### well-formed string
- is string of ()s is it ordered correctly?
- can use a counter that adds 1 if it encounters opening, -1 if closing, if ever < 0, will be false.
