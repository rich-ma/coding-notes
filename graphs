# graphs
density: E / V(V-1)
max density, closer to 1, more dense, closer to 0 more sparse

in a directed graph this changes, need to add connections both ways vs in undirected.

- need to add in In Edges, will double number of edges, n(n-1) more edges, 

## twitter
- vertices are users as well, need to be more nuances, but now instead of friendships we have followers, User A can follow B, b-> A, or b<->a
- some subgraphs might be very dense, like a family, but the entirely of twitter will be sparse.
- this is how friend algorithsm are kind of done.
- Why is density important?
  - for **algorithms**
  - for some graphs the more dense it is, time could be linear or quadratic


## Trees
Binary search tree can represent a graph
not the only kind of tree, to make a graph a tree, has **N vertices, N-1 edges.**
Will never have cycles in our graph.

**DOM is a tree as well, Document Object Model.**
- Vertices: DOM elements
- Edges: parents-children, are connected, not going to connect grandparents and children, just parent-children
