Given a  2D Array, :

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
We define an hourglass in  to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in 's graphical representation:

a b c
  d
e f g
There are  hourglasses in , and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in , then print the maximum hourglass sum.

For example, given the 2D array:

-9 -9 -9  1 1 1 
 0 -9  0  4 3 2
-9 -9 -9  1 2 3
 0  0  8  6 6 0
 0  0  0 -2 0 0
 0  0  1  2 4 0
We calculate the following  hourglass values:

-63, -34, -9, 12, 
-10, 0, 28, 23, 
-27, -11, -2, 10, 
9, 17, 25, 18
Our highest hourglass value is  from the hourglass:

0 4 3
  1
8 6 6

Function Description

Complete the function hourglassSum in the editor below. It should return an integer, the maximum hourglass sum in the array.

hourglassSum has the following parameter(s):

arr: an array of integers
Input Format

Each of the  lines of inputs  contains  space-separated integers .

Constraints

Output Format

Print the largest (maximum) hourglass sum found in .

Sample Input

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0
Sample Output

19

- arrays are shaped like a capital I, 16 exist from top left to bottom right, need to find each one in the array.
- is array single array?

- will use arr[i][j] to indicate i = row, j = column
- until i < arr[i].length - 3 and i < arr.length - 2 we will add [j] - [j + 2], [i+1][j+1], and [i+2][j] to [i+2][j + 2];


```javascript
// Complete the hourglassSum function below.
function hourglassSum(arr) {
    let best = false;
    let i = 0;
    let j = 0;
    let length = arr[0].length;
    while (i < arr.length - 2) {
        while (j < length - 2) {
            let currSum = (arr[i][j] + arr[i][j + 1] + arr[i][j + 2] + arr[i + 1][j + 1] + arr[i + 2][j] + arr[i + 2][j + 1] + arr[i + 2][j + 2]);
            if (best === false || currSum > best) {
                best = currSum;
            } 
            j++;            
        }
        i++
    }
    return best;
}
```
