You are given an unordered array consisting of consecutive integers  [1, 2, 3, ..., n] without any duplicates. You are allowed to swap any two elements. You need to find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.

For example, given the array  we perform the following steps:

i   arr                         swap (indices)
0   [7, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]   swap (0,3)
1   [2, 1, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]   swap (0,1)
2   [1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]   swap (3,4)
3   [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 5, 6]   swap (4,5)
4   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6]   swap (5,6)
5   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
It took  swaps to sort the array.

Function Description

Complete the function minimumSwaps in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the minimum number of swaps to sort the array.

minimumSwaps has the following parameter(s):

arr: an unordered array of integers
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , the size of . 
The second line contains  space-separated integers .

Constraints

Output Format

Return the minimum number of swaps to sort the given array.

- swapping is odd in this method, its not greedy sorting, seems random?
- Could have made a mistake in the examples, will try greedy sort first and see if it works or not.

```javascript
function minimumSwaps(arr) {
    let swaps = 0;
    let currIndex = 0;
    let swappedIndex = 0;
    let sorted = arr.slice();
    sorted = sorted.sort();
    console.log(sorted);
    arr.forEach((num, i) => {
        console.log(i);
        if (arr[i] != sorted[i]) {
            swaps += 1;
        }
    });
    if (swaps === 0) return 0;
    return swaps - 1;
}
```
- this code looks at the numbers in the wrong positions and assumes that any mistake can be fixed by that number - 1, passes the practice solutions, but not the actual submission.
