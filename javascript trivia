# Javascript Trivia

high level interpreted programming language
- dynamic
- weakly typed
  - will allow type coersion
- prototype-based
  - makes copies through prototypes
- multi-paradigm
- single threaded
- concurrent
- never blocking
  - doesn't wait for things to occur or finish(except for alerts)

## parallel and concurrency
---
```concurrency:``` processes can run independently of each other

```parallel:``` different processes working at the same time

```javascript engine```: looks at all the JS code and turns it into things that can be run by computer. interprets JS code into runnable commands

```javascript runtime environment```: way for js code to interact with things outside of the code(document listeners, etc) Gives code way to communicate with outside world. 

runtime api:
- DOM, AJAX calls, Timeout(setTimeout)

```callback```: function passed into an argument of another function
- doesnt mean its asynchronous all the time.

```promise```: an object that represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asychronous call.

Hoisting:
* Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all _**declarations**_ to the top of the current scope (ie: current script or function).

```primitives in javascript:```
1. numbers
2. null
3. boolean
4. undef
5. string
6. symbol(new in ES6)

- string class that wraps the string primitive that allows functions onto the string primitive
