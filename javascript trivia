# Javascript Trivia

high level interpreted programming language
- dynamic
- weakly typed
  - will allow type coersion
- prototype-based
  - makes copies through prototypes
- multi-paradigm
- single threaded
- concurrent
- never blocking
  - doesn't wait for things to occur or finish(except for alerts)

## parallel and concurrency
---
```concurrency:``` processes can run independently of each other

```parallel:``` different processes working at the same time

```javascript engine```: looks at all the JS code and turns it into things that can be run by computer. interprets JS code into runnable commands

```javascript runtime environment```: way for js code to interact with things outside of the code(document listeners, etc) Gives code way to communicate with outside world. 

runtime api:
- DOM, AJAX calls, Timeout(setTimeout)

```callback```: function passed into an argument of another function
- doesnt mean its asynchronous all the time.

```promise```: an object that represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asychronous call.

Hoisting:
* Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all _**declarations**_ to the top of the current scope (ie: current script or function).

**primitives in javascript:**
1. numbers
2. null
3. boolean
4. undef
5. string
6. symbol(new in ES6)

- string class that wraps the string primitive that allows functions onto the string primitive

## DOM Manipulation
window: the browser

document: document represents the DOM, the actual html on the page. Lives on the window.

does document.onload and window.onload fire at the same time?
- document.onload will fire first since it is within window. Window.onload will fire after everything else has loaded.
- 

different ways to get element from DOM
- getElementById,
- getElementByClassName,
- getElementByTagName,
- getElementByName,
- **return node list**
- querySelector('div')
- 

What is the fastest wayot select elements by using css selectors?
- id or class is the fastest

Can we use forEach or array emthods on NodeList?
- cant use forEach, can use for, or convert it to Array(Array.from)

How do you implement getElementsByAttribute?
```JavaScript
function getElementsByAttribute(attribute){
  let allElements = document.getElementsByTagName('*'),
      el, found=[];
  for (let i = 0; i < allElements.length; i++) {
    el = allElements[i];
    if (el.getAttribute(attribute)) {
      found.push(el);
    }
  }
  return found;
}
```
- get all the elements, check that element if it has the attribute we're looking for
- 

how could you add a class to an element by query selector?
```JavaScript
function addClass(attribute, className) {
  const els = document.querySelector(attribute);
  for (let i = 0; i < els.length; i++) {
    const el = els[i];
    el.classList.add(className);
  }
}
```

how do we verify if one element is a child of another element?


best way to create DOM element?
- document.body.innterHTML = "<div> fdfdsfsd </div>"

what is createDocumentFragment and why might you use it?
- document fragment is a mini DOM with methods on it, can build the same board over and over, can append things to it, and can append the fragment anywhere into the html we like.

```javascript
let list = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'...], el, text;
const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
       const el = document.createElement('div');
    const text = document.createTextNode(list[i]);
    el.appendChild(text);
    fragment.appendChild(el);
}
document.body.appendChild(fragment);
```

what is reflow? What causes reflow? How could you reduce reflow?
- inserting or removing thing from dom that takes up space, takes up calculating power


what is repaint, when does it happen?
- changing a property of something that doesn't change the reflow
- chanigng color of text, not super costly.

How could you make sure to run some JS when the dom is ready, i.e. $(document).ready?
- put script at the end of the body.
- document add event listener, DOM content loaded,
- could use jquery if we wanted(not good)
- document.onreadystatechange = function()

what is event bubbling?
- when you trigger an event on a page, browser doesnt know what you clicked on speficically, will traverse through dom until it finds the element you clicked on,
- the click handler will execute of the thing you clicked first, then up the parents to the body until there is a stop. or it gets to the top
-  can pass a third variable that will do it on oposite way
- targeting -> capture -> bubbling

what is difference between event.target and event.currentTarget?
- if something is nested, target is the most specific.
- 

How do you capture all clicks on the page?
- put even listener on the body, all clicks on page would eventually bubble up to body.

how do you grab all text on page?
- document.body.innerText

what does float do?
- takes e

how can you clear sides of a floating element?
- clear property on both.

what are pseudo selectors?
- :hover, :nth-of-type, :visited, :focus, :link, :child, :checked, :last-child, :target
- only applied under certain conditions

different positions in CSS?
- static: default,
- absolute: relative to nearest non static ancesor
- fixed: relative to window
- relative:
- sticky

what are the differences between inline, block, inline-block?
- inline, padding affects left right, but not top bottom
- block breaks the 
- inline-block: will float with document, but can set width, height, margin, padding properties.

are css properties case sensitive?
- 

how can you highlight text using html?
- can use mark tag.

how can you reverse txt on page using only html?
- bdo

what is semantic html?
- html tag describes content, not different than div, examples: nav, header, footer, 

optional closing tag?
- paragraphs don't need closing

why do you need doctype at the beginning of html?
- so browser knows what type of test it ix.
- browser will run in work mode without the type, don't have access to all the new style conventions that we made, limiting functionalty if browser.

what happens when you zoom?
- change size of pixels

what does the <details> tag do?
- gives us a toggle-able to show more info.
