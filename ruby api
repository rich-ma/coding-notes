# using ruby for api calls
- can use Net:HTTP
- Can also use HTTParty

- with Net::HTTP need to get url first,
  -URI.parse(url)
  then with that we call Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)
  - then with the response we get the body
  - with the body we parse it from json, JSON.parse(body)
  - then we can play with the response in a hash like object.
